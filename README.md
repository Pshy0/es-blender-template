# Endless Sky - Blender Template - Outfit / Ship

When I used the official ES outfit template, the render was bad, and blender unstable.

So I re-made the templates with my version of blender, with as many settings as possible to default:
 - [outfit template (`outfit.blend`, Blender 3.4.1)](./outfit.blend)
 - [ship template (`ship.blend`, Blender 3.4.1)](./ship.blend)

- [Creating Ships](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/CreatingShips)
